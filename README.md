# FPGA-implementation-Aware-Neural-Architecture-Search

In this project, we provide a NAS engine with FPGA implementation aware ability.

Users can overide script PARA and PERFORMANCE_DUMMY to get customized FPGA implementation performance.

The NAS engine is partially based on an open source project from Somshubra Majumdar.
